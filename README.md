Another small project to teach myself Angular.
Made using the PokéAPI, it will display 12 pokemons by default on each page.
I had to make a few quick fixes to arrange pokemons so it doesn't look bad.


## Optimizations

- CSS is almost non-existant. It will get worked in the future.

- Display cards colours according to the pokemon type.

- Clean the code a bit more and optimize the sorting of pokemons.

- Add a search option, it should be easy.
